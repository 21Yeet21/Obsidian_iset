## Module 6.1: How the OSPF Protocol Works

**Overview:**  
This section explains the inner workings of the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol when used in a single-area setup. OSPF is a *link-state routing protocol*, meaning it helps routers share information about the network’s structure (like roads on a map) so they can figure out the best paths to send data. Unlike simpler protocols, OSPF builds a detailed picture of the network, making it efficient and scalable, especially in a single area (usually called "area 0").

**Key Components:**  
- **Adjacency Database**: Think of this as a contact list of nearby routers. It tracks which routers are directly connected and ready to talk. Without this, routers can’t share info.
- **Link-State Database (LSDB)**: This is the network’s blueprint. Every router contributes details (called *link-state advertisements* or LSAs) about its connections, and all routers sync up to have the same map.
- **Routing Table**: Once the map is ready, OSPF uses it to pick the fastest routes to every destination and lists them here—like a GPS giving you the best driving directions.

**OSPF’s Communication Tools (Packets):**  
OSPF uses five types of messages to keep everything running smoothly:  
- **Hello**: A friendly handshake to find neighbors and check if they’re still around.

- **Database Description (DBD)**: A quick summary of the network map, shared between routers to see if they’re on the same page.  
- **Link-State Request (LSR)**: A polite “Can you send me more details?” when a router needs specific updates.  
- **Link-State Update (LSU)**: The full scoop—detailed updates about the network sent to neighbors.  
- **Link-State Acknowledgment (LSAck)**: A “Got it!” to confirm updates were received, ensuring nothing gets lost.

**How OSPF Gets the Job Done (Convergence):**  
1. **Finding Friends**: Routers send Hello packets to meet their neighbors and agree to work together (forming *adjacencies*).  
2. **Syncing the Map**: They swap DBDs and LSUs until their LSDBs match perfectly.  
3. **Calculating Routes**: Each router uses the *Shortest Path First (SPF)* algorithm (a math trick invented by Dijkstra) to find the quickest paths.  
4. **Updating Directions**: The best routes go into the routing table, ready to guide data traffic.

**Why It Matters:**  
In a single-area setup (like area 0), OSPF keeps things simple yet powerful. It’s fast at updating routes when something changes (like a roadblock) and can grow with your network. Understanding this helps you manage and fix network issues effectively.

**OSPF** passe par plusieurs états en tentant d'atteindre la
convergence :
• Down : aucun paquet Hello n'est reçu ; le routeur envoie les paquets Hello
• Init : les paquets Hello sont reçus et contiennent l'ID du routeur
expéditeur
• Two-Way : permet de choisir un DR et BDR sur une liaison Ethernet • ExStart : permet de négocier la relation de maître/esclave et le
numéro de séquence du paquet DBD ; le maître débute l'échange de
paquet DBD
• Exchange : les routeurs échangent des paquets DBD. Si des
informations supplémentaires sont nécessaires sur le routeur,
passez à l'état de chargement (Loading). Dans le cas contraire,
passez à l'état Full
• Loading : les paquets LSR et LSU sont utilisés pour obtenir d'autres
informations concernant la route ; les routes sont traitées à l'aide de
l'algorithme shortest path first (SPF) ; transition vers l'état

## Module 6.2: Setting Up OSPFv2 for Single-Area IPv4 Networks

**Overview:**  
This part walks you through configuring OSPFv2, the version of OSPF for IPv4 networks (the older internet address system). It’s a step-by-step guide to get routers talking and routing data efficiently in a single area.

```
router ospf id-processus
```

**Configuration Steps Made Simple:**  
- **Give Each Router a Name (Router ID)**: Every router needs a unique ID, like a name tag. You can set it yourself with a command like `router-id 1.1.1.1`, or OSPF picks one from the highest IP address on the router’s interfaces (e.g., a loopback or Ethernet port).  
- Exécutez la commande `show ip protocols` pour vérifier l'ID de routeur.
- Utilisez la commande `clear ip ospf process` après avoir modifié l'ID de routeur pour rendre la modification effective.

- **Turn OSPF On**: Use the `network` command (e.g., `network 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0`) to tell OSPF which interfaces (network connections) to use. The “0.0.0.255” part is a *wildcard mask* that says “include all addresses in this range.” Or, you can activate specific interfaces directly.

- ![[Pasted image 20250504175642.png]]
- **Quiet Down Unused Ports (Passive Interfaces)**: Use `passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/0` to stop OSPF from chatting on interfaces connected to devices like PCs. This cuts down on noise and boosts security.![[Pasted image 20250504175738.png]]



**Choosing the Best Path (Cost Metric):**  
OSPF picks routes based on *cost*, which depends on how fast an interface is (bandwidth). Lower cost = better path. You can tweak this:  
![[Pasted image 20250504180154.png]]
- **Update the Speed Standard**: Use `auto-cost reference-bandwidth 1000` to tell OSPF that modern links are faster (e.g., 1000 Mbps) than the default old-school setting.  
- **Adjust Bandwidth**: On slower links (like serial connections), set the real speed with `bandwidth 64` (for 64 Kbps).  
- **Set Cost Directly**: For total control, use `ip ospf cost 15625` on an interface to override the automatic cost.

**Checking Your Work:**  
Use these commands to make sure everything’s running right:  
- **`show ip ospf neighbor`**: Lists your router’s buddies—shows if adjacencies are formed.  
- **`show ip protocols`**: Confirms OSPF is active, shows your router ID, and lists networks it’s handling.  
- **`show ip ospf interface`**: Checks each OSPF interface’s settings and status.

**Pro Tip:**  
Set up a *loopback interface* (e.g., `interface Loopback0` with `ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255`) for a rock-solid router ID that doesn’t change if a physical port fails. This module stresses getting these details right for a smooth OSPFv2 network.

## Module 6.3: Setting Up OSPFv3 for Single-Area IPv6 Networks

**Overview:**  
This section covers OSPFv3, the updated OSPF for IPv6 (the newer, roomier internet address system). It’s similar to OSPFv2 but tweaked to handle IPv6’s bigger addresses and some cool new tricks.

**Configuration Steps Explained:**  
- **Turn On IPv6**: Make sure your router supports IPv6 with commands like `ipv6 unicast-routing`.  
- **Assign a Router ID**: Just like OSPFv2, give it a unique 32-bit ID (e.g., `ipv6 router ospf 1` then `router-id 1.1.1.1`).  
- **Activate OSPF on Interfaces**: Use `ipv6 ospf 1 area 0` on each interface you want in the OSPF game. Unlike OSPFv2, you don’t need a `network` command—OSPFv3 works directly with interfaces.

**What’s Different from OSPFv2:**  
- **IPv6 Support**: OSPFv3 handles IPv6 addresses, which are longer (128-bit) than IPv4’s (32-bit).  
- **Link-Local Addresses**: It uses special IPv6 addresses (starting with `fe80::`) for talking to neighbors, making communication more efficient.  
- **Multiple Address Families**: OSPFv3 can manage both IPv4 and IPv6 (though this module focuses on IPv6).

**How It Works:**  
The core ideas—LSDB syncing, SPF calculations—are the same as OSPFv2. But OSPFv3 adapts them for IPv6’s world, keeping routing fast and reliable.

**Checking Your Setup:**  
Use these commands to verify OSPFv3:  
- **`show ipv6 ospf neighbor`**: Shows your IPv6 neighbors and their link-local addresses.  
- **`show ipv6 protocols`**: Confirms OSPFv3 is running and shows its settings.  
- **`show ipv6 ospf interface`**: Details each interface’s OSPFv3 status.

**Why It’s Useful:**  
As networks shift to IPv6, OSPFv3 is your go-to. This module helps you understand its quirks (like link-local addresses) so you can set up and manage IPv6 routing confidently in a single-area network.
