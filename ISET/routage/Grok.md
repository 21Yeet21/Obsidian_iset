## Chapter 1: Routing Fundamentals
This section lays the groundwork for understanding how routing works, introducing key concepts you’ll need for your exam.

- **Routing Tables and Packet Forwarding**:
  - Routers use **routing tables** to decide where to send packets. These tables list possible destinations (networks) and the next hop (interface or neighbor) to reach them.
  - Example: If a packet arrives with no configured routes (static or dynamic), the routing table only contains **directly connected networks** (e.g., interfaces with IP addresses). No default or learned routes exist yet.
  - Key Command: `show ip route` (Cisco) displays the routing table—crucial for troubleshooting.

- **Static vs. Dynamic Routing**:
  - **Static Routes**: Manually configured by an admin. Example: `ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 ethernet1/0` directs traffic to the 192.168.2.0/24 network via Ethernet1/0.
  - **Dynamic Routes**: Learned automatically via protocols like RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP. These adapt to network changes.
  - **Default Route**: A catch-all route (e.g., `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.3.1`) used when no specific route matches. Think of it as the "if all else fails" option.

- **Route Selection Criteria**:
  - **Administrative Distance (AD)**: Determines trustworthiness of a route source (e.g., static = 1, RIP = 120, OSPF = 110). Lower AD wins.
  - **Metric**: Within a protocol, the best path is chosen by the lowest metric (e.g., hop count in RIP, cost in OSPF).
  - Example: If RIP and OSPF advertise the same route, OSPF’s lower AD (110 vs. 120) takes precedence.

- **Routing Loops**:
  - Occur when packets cycle endlessly due to misconfiguration or protocol issues.
  - Causes: Incorrect static routes, slow convergence in dynamic protocols.
  - Prevention: Techniques like split horizon, holddown timers (more on these in RIP).

**Exam Tip**: Memorize AD values and understand that a router fragments packets if they exceed the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) unless told otherwise.

## Chapter 2: RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
RIP is a distance-vector protocol—simple but limited. Here’s everything you need for your exam.

- **RIP Basics**:
  - **Type**: Distance-vector—routers share their full routing table with neighbors.
  - **Metric**: Hop count (max 15 hops; 16 is "infinite," meaning unreachable).
  - **Updates**: Sent every 30 seconds via UDP port 520, broadcasting the entire table (consumes bandwidth).

- **RIPv1 vs. RIPv2**:
  - **RIPv1**:
    - Classful (no subnet masks in updates).
    - Broadcasts updates (255.255.255.255).
    - Doesn’t support VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking).
  - **RIPv2**:
    - Classless (includes subnet masks).
    - Multicasts updates (224.0.0.9).
    - Supports VLSM—key for modern networks.
    - Authentication supported (unlike RIPv1).

- **Loop Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - **Split Horizon**: Don’t advertise a route back to the neighbor you learned it from.
  - **Holddown Timer**: After a route is marked unreachable, ignore updates about it for a period (e.g., 180 seconds) to ensure consistency.
  - **Maximum Hop Count**: Limits routes to 15 hops, stopping infinite loops.
  - **Route Poisoning**: Advertise an unreachable route with hop count 16 to kill it fast.

- **Configuration**:
  - Enable RIP: `router rip` (enter RIP config mode).
  - Specify networks: `network 192.168.1.0` (advertises directly connected 192.168.1.0 network).
  - For RIPv2: `version 2` and disable auto-summary with `no auto-summary` for VLSM support.
  - Adjust metrics: `rip metricin`/`metricout` on interfaces to tweak hop counts.

- **Limitations**:
  - Best for small networks (<15 hops).
  - Slow convergence—updates every 30s mean delays after topology changes.
  - Example Issue: Discontiguous networks (e.g., 10.1.1.0/29 and 10.1.1.16/29) fail with RIPv1 due to no VLSM.

**Exam Tip**: Know RIP’s hop limit and loop prevention cold. Questions often test why RIP fails in large or complex networks—bandwidth hogging and slow convergence are your answers.

## Chapter 3: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
OSPF is a link-state protocol—more complex but scalable. Master this for your exam!

- **OSPF Basics**:
  - **Type**: Link-state—routers build a topology map using LSAs (Link State Advertisements).
  - **Metric**: Cost (based on bandwidth, e.g., 10^8/bandwidth in bps).
  - **Algorithm**: Dijkstra’s SPF (Shortest Path First) calculates the best path.

- **Key Features**:
  - Hierarchical: Uses **areas** to reduce routing overhead. Area 0 (backbone) connects all areas.
  - Fast convergence: Updates are event-triggered, not periodic.
  - Multicasts updates (224.0.0.5 for all OSPF routers, 224.0.0.6 for DR/BDR).

- **Router Roles**:
  - **Router ID (RID)**: Unique identifier (highest loopback IP, or highest physical IP if no loopback, unless manually set with `router-id`).
  - **Designated Router (DR)**: Elected on multi-access networks to reduce LSA flooding. Priority (default 1) or highest RID wins.
  - **Backup DR (BDR)**: Backup for DR.

- **Neighbor Adjacency**:
  - Process: 
    1. **Init**: Send Hello packets (every 10s by default).
    2. **Two-Way**: Both routers see each other in Hellos.
    3. **ExStart**: Negotiate master/slave for DB exchange.
    4. **Exchange**: Share Database Description (DD) packets.
    5. **Loading**: Request missing LSAs via LSR (Link-State Request).
    6. **Full**: Adjacency formed, databases synced.
  - Hello/Dead Intervals: Must match (default 10s/40s). Test scenario: If R1’s Dead is 20s and R2’s Hello is 10s, adjacency fails.

- **Configuration**:
  - Enable OSPF: `router ospf 1` (1 is process ID).
  - Advertise networks: `network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0` (wildcards, not subnet masks!).
  - Manual RID: `router-id 1.1.1.1`.
  - For inter-VLAN routing (router-on-a-stick): Add all sub-interface networks to OSPF.

- **LSA Types**:
  - **Type 1 (Router LSA)**: Lists a router’s links.
  - **Type 2 (Network LSA)**: From DR, describes multi-access networks.
  - **Type 3 (Summary LSA)**: Inter-area routes from ABRs (Area Border Routers).

- **Advantages**:
  - Scales to large networks via areas.
  - Supports VLSM and CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing).
  - Load balancing over equal-cost paths.

**Exam Tip**: OSPF questions love timers (Hello/Dead) and area benefits. Know that a multi-area setup isolates SPF recalculations to the affected area—huge for stability!

## Chapter 4: EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
EIGRP is Cisco’s hybrid protocol—distance-vector with link-state perks. Here’s the rundown.

- **EIGRP Basics**:
  - **Type**: Advanced distance-vector (uses DUAL algorithm).
  - **Metric**: Composite (bandwidth, delay, reliability, load; default uses bandwidth + delay).
  - **Updates**: Event-triggered, partial (only changes), via multicast (224.0.0.10).

- **DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm)**:
  - Ensures loop-free paths by tracking:
    - **Successor**: Best path to a destination (lowest metric).
    - **Feasible Successor (FS)**: Backup path (must meet Feasibility Condition: Reported Distance < Feasible Distance of successor).
  - Fast convergence: Switches to FS instantly if successor fails.

- **Configuration**:
  - Enable EIGRP: `router eigrp 1` (1 is Autonomous System number).
  - Advertise networks: `network 192.168.1.0`.
  - Disable auto-summary: `no auto-summary` (critical for VLSM/discontiguous networks like 2.2.2.0/24).

- **Load Balancing**:
  - Supports **unequal-cost load balancing** (unlike OSPF’s equal-cost only) via `variance` command (e.g., `variance 2` uses paths up to 2x the best metric).

- **Features**:
  - VLSM support.
  - Partial updates reduce bandwidth use.
  - Cisco-proprietary (unlike OSPF).

- **Example**:
  - With auto-summary on, 192.168.10.0/30 and 172.16.0.0/16 might be summarized incorrectly, breaking reachability. Fix: `no auto-summary`.

**Exam Tip**: EIGRP’s edge is unequal-cost balancing and fast rerouting via FS. Know DUAL and why `no auto-summary` matters in modern networks.

## Chapter 5: IP Addressing and Subnetting (Routing Context)
Routing relies on proper addressing—expect subnetting and VLSM/CIDR questions!

- **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)**:
  - Allows different subnet masks within the same network (e.g., /24 split into /27 and /30).
  - Example: 193.14.68.0/24 → First subnet for 30 hosts = 193.14.68.0/27 (32 addresses, 30 usable).

- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**:
  - Aggregates routes (e.g., 172.168.16.0/24 to 172.168.19.0/24 → 172.168.16.0/22).
  - Reduces routing table size.

- **Subnetting Example**:
  - **193.14.68.32/27**:
    - Range: 193.14.68.32–63.
    - Last usable: 193.14.68.62 (63 is broadcast).
  - **10.10.240.0/20**:
    - Range: 10.10.240.0–10.10.255.255.
    - Subnets used: 10.10.247.121 and 10.10.248.10. Next subnet starts at 10.10.249.1.

- **Routing Impact**:
  - Misaligned subnets (e.g., overlapping 192.168.10.0/30 on serial links) cause routing failures.
  - Null0 routes (e.g., `ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 Null0`) prevent loops by dropping unmatched traffic.

**Exam Tip**: Practice subnetting fast—know usable ranges and spot overlaps. CIDR aggregation is a common trick question!

## Chapter 6: NAT and PAT (Routing-Related)
Network Address Translation affects routing—here’s what matters.

- **NAT Basics**:
  - Maps private IPs (e.g., 192.168.1.0) to public IPs.
  - Occurs **after routing**—router decides the path, then translates.

- **PAT (Port Address Translation)**:
  - Maps multiple private IPs to one public IP using ports.
  - Example: 50 private IPs → 1 public IP via unique source ports (distinguished in NAT table).

- **Types**:
  - **Static NAT**: Fixed 1:1 mapping.
  - **Dynamic NAT**: Pool-based mapping.
  - **NAPT/PAT**: Port-based, most efficient for limited public IPs.

**Exam Tip**: Know PAT’s port mechanism and that NAT follows routing in the order of operations.

## Chapter 7: ACLs (Access Control Lists) in Routing
ACLs filter traffic, impacting routing decisions.

- **Types**:
  - **Standard ACL**: Filters based on source IP (e.g., `acl 2001 rule permit source 10.0.1.0 0.0.0.255`).
  - **Extended ACL**: Source, destination, protocol, ports (more granular).

- **Behavior**:
  - Processed top-down; first match applies.
  - Example: `rule 10 deny 20.1.1.0 0.0.0.255` then `rule 20 permit 20.1.1.0 0.0.0.255`—deny wins due to order.

- **Routing Use**:
  - Controls which packets are routed (e.g., block 10.0.1.0/24 from reaching a network).

**Exam Tip**: Order matters—lower rule numbers execute first. Expect scenarios testing permit/deny conflicts.

---

## Chapter 8: STP/RSTP (Spanning Tree Protocol in Routing Context)
While STP is Layer 2, it interacts with routing in switched networks.

- **STP**:
  - Prevents loops by blocking redundant paths.
  - Root Bridge elected via lowest Bridge ID (priority + MAC).
  - Ports: Root, Designated, Blocked.

- **RSTP**:
  - Faster convergence.
  - **Edge Ports**: Connect to hosts, forward instantly.
  - **Alternate Ports**: Backup to root, switch fast on failure.

- **Routing Interaction**:
  - Ensures a loop-free Layer 2 topology for routed traffic.

**Exam Tip**: Know RSTP’s edge/alternate roles—questions may tie this to inter-VLAN routing setups.
