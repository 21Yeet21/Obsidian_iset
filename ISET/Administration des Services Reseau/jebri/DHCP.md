### **Chapter 1: Introduction to DHCP and Its Role in Network Infrastructure**

**Summary:**  
DHCP is a standardized IP protocol that simplifies network management by automating the assignment of IP addresses and other configuration parameters to network devices (clients). It reduces the administrative burden, minimizes errors from manual configuration, and ensures devices are correctly configured for TCP/IP-based networks.

**Key Roles of DHCP:**
- **Simplifies Administration:** Automates IP configuration, reducing manual effort.
- **Centralized Management:** Allows IP allocation to be managed from one location.
- **Error Reduction:** Prevents mistakes like duplicate IP addresses.
- **Adaptability:** Updates client configurations when network settings change.

**Detailed Explanation of Terms:**
- **Protocol:** A set of rules for communication between devices; DHCP is an IP protocol for configuration.
- **IP Address:** A unique identifier (e.g., 192.168.1.10) for devices on a network.
- **TCP/IP:** The foundational protocol suite for internet and network communication; DHCP operates within this framework.
- **Infrastructure:** The underlying network components (servers, routers, etc.) that DHCP supports.
- **Client:** A device (e.g., computer, phone) that requests configuration from a DHCP server.
- **Server:** A device running DHCP software to assign IP addresses and settings.

### **Chapter 2: Allocation of IP Addresses by DHCP**

**Summary:**  
DHCP allocates IP addresses dynamically through a leasing mechanism, where a client temporarily uses an IP address for a specified duration. This process can serve one or multiple subnets from a centralized server.

**Process Overview:**
- DHCP assigns IP addresses from a defined pool and releases them when no longer needed.
- It supports both single-subnet and multi-subnet environments.

**Detailed Explanation of Terms:**
- **Dynamic Allocation:** IP addresses are assigned temporarily, unlike static (permanent) assignments.
- **Lease:** The temporary assignment of an IP address, including its duration (e.g., 6000 seconds).
- **Subnet:** A segment of a network with a shared network address (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
- **Centralized Site:** A single DHCP server managing IP assignments across the network.

### **Chapter 3: The Process of Creating and Renewing a DHCP Lease**

**Summary:**  
DHCP uses a four-phase process to create a lease and a two-phase process to renew it, ensuring clients maintain valid IP configurations.

**Lease Creation (Four Phases):**
1. **DHCPDISCOVER:** The client broadcasts this packet to find DHCP servers.
2. **DHCPOFFER:** Servers respond with an offered IP address and settings.
3. **DHCPREQUEST:** The client broadcasts acceptance of an offer.
4. **DHCPACK:** The server confirms the lease with the IP address and configuration.

**Lease Renewal:**
1. **DHCPREQUEST:** The client unicasts a renewal request to the original server.
2. **DHCPACK:** The server acknowledges, extending the lease.

**Detailed Explanation of Terms:**
- **Broadcast:** A message sent to all devices on a subnet (e.g., DHCPDISCOVER).
- **Unicast:** A direct message to one device (e.g., renewal DHCPREQUEST).
- **Packet:** A unit of data exchanged in the DHCP process.
- **Bail (Lease):** French term for lease; the duration a client can use an IP address.
- **Initialization:** The point when TCP/IP settings are applied to the client after receiving DHCPACK.

### **Chapter 4: DHCP Scopes**

**Summary:**  
A DHCP scope defines a range of IP addresses available for leasing to clients on a specific subnet. Each scope has properties that customize the configuration for that subnet.

**Scope Properties:**
- **Network ID:** The subnet’s identifier (e.g., 192.168.1.0).
- **Subnet Mask (Option 1):** Defines network vs. host portions (e.g., 255.255.255.0).
- **Routers (Option 3):** Default gateway IP (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **Domain Name Servers (Option 6):** DNS server IPs (e.g., 192.168.1.254).
- **Host Name (Option 12):** The client’s assigned name.
- **Domain Name (Option 15):** The network’s domain (e.g., "domaine.local").
- **Broadcast Address (Option 28):** The subnet’s broadcast IP (e.g., 192.168.1.255).
- **Lease Time (Option 51):** Duration in seconds (e.g., 6000).
- **Range:** The IP pool (e.g., 192.168.1.10–192.168.1.30).
- **Exclusion Range:** IPs reserved and excluded from dynamic allocation.

**Detailed Explanation of Terms:**
- **Étendue (Scope):** French for scope; a range of assignable IPs.
- **Plage (Range):** The specific IP address pool within a scope.
- **DNS:** Domain Name System; resolves names (e.g., google.com) to IPs.
- **ARPA Domain:** Refers to reverse DNS (e.g., in-addr.arpa).

### **Chapter 5: DHCP Reservations**

**Summary:**  
Reservations assign a fixed IP address to a specific client within a scope, identified by its MAC address, ensuring consistency for devices like servers or printers.

**How It Works:**
- Defined using the `host` clause in the DHCP configuration.
- Requires the client’s MAC address (e.g., `hardware ethernet 00:11:22:33:44:55`).
- Assigns a fixed IP (e.g., `fixed-address 192.168.1.5`).

**Key Points:**
- Fixed IPs must not overlap with the dynamic range.
- Useful with `deny unknown-clients` to restrict access to known devices.

**Detailed Explanation of Terms:**
- **MAC Address:** A unique 48-bit hardware identifier (e.g., 00:11:22:33:44:55).
- **Fixed Address:** A static IP assigned via DHCP reservation.
- **Host Clause:** A configuration block for a specific client.
- **Deny Unknown-Clients:** A setting to block unrecognized devices.

### **Chapter 6: DHCP Options**

**Summary:**  
DHCP options are additional settings provided to clients beyond the IP address, applied at various levels (server, scope, class, or reservation).

**Common Options:**
- See scope properties (e.g., subnet mask, routers, DNS servers).
- **Option 60:** Vendor class identifier for custom configurations.

**Application Levels:**
- **Server:** Applies to all clients.
- **Scope:** Specific to a subnet.
- **Class:** Vendor or user-defined groups.
- **Reservation:** Specific to a reserved client.

**Detailed Explanation of Terms:**
- **Option:** A configuration parameter (e.g., Option 3 = routers).
- **Passerelle (Gateway):** French for gateway; the router IP.
- **Class:** A category of clients with shared settings.

### **Chapter 7: DHCP Relay Agent**

**Summary:**  
A DHCP relay agent forwards DHCP messages between clients and servers across subnets, enabling DHCP in multi-subnet networks.

**Operation:**
1. Client broadcasts DHCPDISCOVER.
2. Relay unicasts it to the server.
3. Server sends DHCPOFFER to the relay.
4. Relay forwards it to the client.
5–8. Similar forwarding for DHCPREQUEST and DHCPACK.

**Features:**
- **Hop Count:** Max routers a packet can cross (e.g., 2).
- **Boot Threshold:** Delay (in seconds) before forwarding to a remote server.

**Detailed Explanation of Terms:**
- **Agent de Relais:** French for relay agent; a router or host facilitating DHCP.
- **BOOTP:** A predecessor to DHCP; relay agents support both.
- **Tronçons (Hops):** French for hops; the number of routers traversed.

### **Chapter 8: Implementing a DHCP Client**

**Summary:**  
A DHCP client requests and applies configuration from a server. In Linux, `dhclient` manages this process, using files like `dhclient.conf` and `dhclient.leases`.

**Key Aspects:**
- **Configuration File (`dhclient.conf`):** Defines interfaces and options.
- **Lease File (`dhclient.leases`):** Tracks leases across reboots.
- **Fallback:** Uses static IPs if the server is unavailable.

**Command Example:**
```
dhclient -cf /etc/dhclient.conf -lf /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases eth0
```

**Detailed Explanation of Terms:**
- **Interface:** The network card (e.g., eth0).
- **Concession (Lease):** French for lease; stored in `dhclient.leases`.
- **PID File:** Stores the process ID (e.g., `/var/run/dhclient.pid`).

### **Configuration of the DHCP Service**

**DHCP Server Configuration (`dhcpd.conf` Example):**
```
ddns-update-style interim;
ddns-updates on;
deny client-updates;
one-lease-per-client false;
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    interface eth0;
    range 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.30;
    default-lease-time 6000;
    max-lease-time 7200;
    option domain-name "domaine.local";
    option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
    option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;
    option routers 192.168.1.1;
    option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.254;
    option time-offset -3600;
}
host printer {
    hardware ethernet 00:11:22:33:44:55;
    fixed-address 192.168.1.5;
}
```
- **Explanation:**
  - Defines a subnet with a dynamic range (192.168.1.10–192.168.1.30).
  - Sets lease times (default 6000s, max 7200s).
  - Includes options (DNS, gateway, etc.).
  - Adds a reservation for a printer.

**DHCP Client Configuration:**
- **File:** `/etc/dhclient.conf` (e.g., `interface "eth0" { request subnet-mask, routers; }`).
- **Command:** `dhclient eth0` or with custom files as shown above.

**Exam Tips:**
- Practice configuring scopes, reservations, and options in `dhcpd.conf`.
- Understand `dhclient` options for client setup.
