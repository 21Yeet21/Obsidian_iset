Here's a concise, organized summary of your networking class notes:

---

### **1. Ethernet Cables (RJ45)**
- **Categories**:  
  - **Cat6a**: Supports higher bandwidth (up to 10 Gbps) over longer distances (100m) with reduced interference.  
  - *Key difference*: Higher categories (e.g., Cat6a vs. Cat5e) support faster data transmission (bandwidth/debit) due to improved shielding and reduced signal loss.  

- **Shielding Types**:  
  - **STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)**: Full shielding against electromagnetic interference (EMI).  
  - **FTP (Foiled Twisted Pair)**: Partial shielding (foil around pairs) for moderate protection.  
  - **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)**: No shielding; prone to interference but cheaper.

### **2. Switches**  
- **Backplane Bandwidth**: Total data capacity (bits/sec) the switch can handle across all ports.  
- **Switching Capacity**: Measured in **MPPS (million packets per second)**; depends on MAC address table efficiency and switching algorithms.  
- **Throughput (Switching Capacity)**:  
  - Formula: `Sum of all port speeds × 2` (full-duplex mode).  
  - Example: A 24-port Gigabit switch = `24 × 1 Gbps × 2 = 48 Gbps`.  
- **Cluster Switches**: Two or more switches operate as a single logical switch for redundancy/scalability.

### **3. Fiber Optic Transceivers**  
- **SFP (Small Form-Factor Pluggable)**: Supports 1 Gbps speeds.  
- **SFP+**: Enhanced version for 10 Gbps speeds.
