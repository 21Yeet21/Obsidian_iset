# Audit
### **Oracle Database Auditing: A Key Field for DBAs**

Auditing in Oracle is the process of monitoring and recording database activities to ensure compliance, security, and accountability. It’s a critical responsibility for DBAs, especially in regulated industries (e.g., finance, healthcare).

#### **Why Auditing Matters**

- **Security**: Track unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
    
- **Compliance**: Meet legal/regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
    
- **Forensics**: Investigate breaches or data tampering.
    
- **Accountability**: Identify who did what, when, and how.
    

#### **Types of Auditing in Oracle**

1. **Standard Auditing**:
    
    - Tracks SQL statements, privileges, schema changes, or user logins.
        
    - Configured via `AUDIT` commands (e.g., `AUDIT SELECT TABLE BY SCOTT;`).
        
    - Audit trails are stored in the `AUD$` table (or in OS files).
        
2. **Unified Auditing** (Introduced in Oracle 12c):
    
    - Combines audit data from multiple sources (database, OS, RMAN) into a single location (`AUDSYS` schema).
        
    - More granular control and better performance.
        
    - Configured using policies (e.g., `CREATE AUDIT POLICY audit_select_policy ACTIONS SELECT;`).
        
3. **Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA)**:
    
    - Monitors specific data access (e.g., auditing SELECT on a column with sensitive data).
        
    - Uses `DBMS_FGA` package (e.g., `DBMS_FGA.ADD_POLICY`).
        

#### **Key Tasks for a DBA**

- Enable/disable auditing.
    
- Review audit logs using views like `DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL` or `UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL`.
    
- Purge or archive old audit data.
    
- Protect audit trails from tampering (e.g., store them in a separate tablespace).
    

#### **Example Audit Scenarios**

- Track all failed login attempts.
    
- Audit changes to salaries in an `EMPLOYEES` table.
    
- Monitor privileged users (e.g., `SYS` or `SYSTEM`).

# Oracle Architecture

Here’s an enhanced explanation of **Oracle Database Server Architecture** based on your teacher’s figure, including all components from the screenshot and additional context for clarity. This is structured to align with the diagram and includes corrections for typos (e.g., process names):

### **Architecture d'un serveur de base de données Oracle**  
Oracle’s architecture consists of **three core layers**: **Memory**, **Processes**, and **Storage**. Here’s a breakdown:

---

#### **1. Mémoire (Memory Structures)**  
The memory layer is divided into the **System Global Area (SGA)** and **Program Global Area (PGA)**. The SGA is shared across the instance , while the PGA is session-specific.  

**Components of the SGA**:  
- **Cache de tampons de la base de données** (Database Buffer Cache):  
  - Stores copies of data blocks read from disk (e.g., tables, indexes).  
  - Reduces I/O operations by caching frequently accessed data.  

- **Tampon de journalisation** (Redo Log Buffer):  
  - Temporarily holds redo entries (changes made to the database) before they are written to disk.  
  - if we use roll back changes will not be written to DB else if we use Commit changes will be written
#####
- **Zone de mémoire partagée** (Shared Pool):  
  - **Cache "Library"** (Library Cache): Stores parsed SQL statements, execution plans, and PL/SQL code.  
  - **Cache du dictionnaire de données** (Data Dictionary Cache): Caches metadata (e.g., table definitions, user privileges).  

---

### **1. Where Are Queries Stored?**

Queries (SQL statements) are cached in the **Library Cache**, a sub-component of the **Shared Pool** within the **SGA** (System Global Area).

- **Library Cache**:
    
    - Stores **parsed SQL statements**, execution plans, and PL/SQL code.
        
    - Helps reuse SQL to avoid repetitive parsing (improves performance).
        
- **Example**:
    
    - If you run `SELECT * FROM employees`, Oracle caches this parsed SQL and its execution plan in the Library Cache.
---
#####
#### **2. Processus (Processes)**  
Processes manage tasks and ensure the database runs efficiently. They fall into three categories:  

**A. Processus utilisateur (User Processes):**  
- Run on client machines (e.g., applications connecting to the database).  

**B. Processus serveur (Server Processes):**  
- Handle requests from user processes (e.g., execute SQL, return results).  

**C. Processus en arrière-plan (Background Processes):**  
- **DBWn (Database Writer):** Writes modified data from the buffer cache to data files.  
- **LGWR (Log Writer):** Writes redo log entries from the redo log buffer to online redo log files.  
- **CKPT (Checkpoint):** Updates control files and data files during checkpoints.  
- **SMON (System Monitor):** Performs crash recovery and cleans up temporary files.  
- **PMON (Process Monitor):** Recovers failed user processes.  
- **ARCn (Archiver):** Copies online redo logs to archive logs for backup/recovery.  
- **RECO (Recoverer):** Resolves distributed transaction failures.  
- **Autres (Others):** Includes processes like MMON (Manageability Monitor) and MMAN (Memory Manager).  

---

#### **3. Stockage (Storage Structures)**  
Physical files stored on disk:  
- **Fichiers de données** (Data Files):  
  - Store actual database data (e.g., tables, indexes).  

- **Fichiers de contrôle** (Control Files):  
  - Contain metadata about the database (e.g., data file locations, database name).  

- **Fichiers de journalisation en ligne** (Online Redo Log Files):  
  - Record all changes made to the database for crash recovery.  
  - Cyclically overwritten once archived (unlike **Fichiers de journalisation archivés** (Archive Log Files)).  

---

### **Key Additions from Your Figure**  
4. **Library Cache & Data Dictionary Cache**: Explicit sub-components of the Shared Pool.  
5. **ARCn (Archiver)**: Critical for backup/recovery; copies redo logs to archive files.  
6. **RECO (Recoverer)**: Resolves issues in distributed transactions.  
7. **Typo Corrections**:  
   - **OBWn → DBWn** (Database Writer).  
   - **CNPT → CKPT** (Checkpoint).  
   - **LOWR → LGWR** (Log Writer).  

---

### **How Auditing Fits In**  
Audit trails (e.g., `AUD$` table or unified audit logs) are stored in **data files**. Policies configured by the DBA are enforced by the **Oracle kernel** (part of the SGA’s shared pool). Background processes like **ARCn** ensure audit logs are archived for compliance.  

---

### **Summary Diagram**  
```
Oracle Architecture Layers:  
8. Memory → SGA (Buffer Cache, Redo Log Buffer, Shared Pool) + PGA  
9. Processes → User, Server, Background (DBWn, LGWR, SMON, etc.)  
10. Storage → Data Files, Control Files, Online/Archive Redo Logs  
```
