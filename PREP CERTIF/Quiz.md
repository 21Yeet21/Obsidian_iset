- **D** – A new router with a higher priority does not automatically become the DR unless the existing DR fails.
- **D** – Router LSAs are generated by all routers, not just the DR.
- **D** – LSAs do not include a destination MAC address; that’s part of the frame header.
- **D** – A new router with a higher priority does not automatically take over as DR.
- **B** – VLANs improve security by isolating traffic.
- **D** – Switches do not always remove VLAN tags; it depends on the port type (e.g., access ports strip tags).
- **B** – MAC-based VLAN allocation is best for devices that move frequently.
- **D** – Trunk interfaces connect switches or routers, not end devices.
- **A** – The command allows only specified VLANs to pass.
- **A** – A switch sends BPDUs to participate in root bridge election.
- **C** – 802.1W defines RSTP.
- **B** – The root port forwards traffic toward the root bridge.
- **A** – An alternate port is a backup to the root port.
- **B** – Access ports strip VLAN tags from incoming frames.
- **B** – G0/0/2 has the lower cost (100) and will be the root port.
- **A** – BPDUs use 802.3 format with a multicast address (01:80:C2:00:00:00).
- **A** – OSPF elects one DR and one BDR per multi-access segment.
- **B** – VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 cannot communicate without a Layer 3 device due to VLAN mismatch.
- **B** – Designated ports forward traffic for a segment away from the root.
- **B** – Higher bandwidth lowers the port cost (e.g., 10 Mbps = cost 100, 1 Gbps = cost 4).
