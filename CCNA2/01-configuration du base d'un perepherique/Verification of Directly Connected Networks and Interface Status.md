### **Detailed Summary of the Section**  

---

#### **1.5.1 Verification of Directly Connected Networks**  
After configuring a router, it‚Äôs essential to verify the configuration and connectivity. The following commands are particularly useful:  

1. **`show ip interface brief` and `show ipv6 interface brief`**:  
   - Display a summary of all interfaces, including IP addresses and operational status.  
   - Example:  
     ```  
     R1# show ip interface brief  
     Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol  
     GigabitEthernet0/0/0   192.168.10.1    YES manual up                    up  
     GigabitEthernet0/0/1   192.168.11.1    YES manual up                    up  
     Serial0/1/0            209.165.200.225 YES manual up                    up  
     Serial0/1/1            unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down  
     ```  

2. **`show running-config interface [interface-id]`**:  
   - Displays the configuration applied to a specific interface.  
   - Example:  
     ```  
     R1# show running-config interface gigabitethernet 0/0/0  
     interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0  
         description Link to LAN 1  
         ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0  
         ipv6 address 2001:DB8:ACAD:1::1/64  
     ```  

3. **`show ip route` and `show ipv6 route`**:  
   - Display the routing table for IPv4 and IPv6.  
   - Directly connected networks are marked with a `C` (Connected) or `L` (Local).  
   - Example:  
     ```  
     R1# show ip route  
     Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP  
     Gateway of last resort is not set  
           192.168.10.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0/0  
           192.168.10.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0/0  
     ```  

**Key Takeaway**: Use these commands to verify interface status, IP configurations, and routing tables.  

---

#### **1.5.2 Verifying Interface Status**  
- **Interface Status**:  
  - **`up/up`**: Interface is operational.  
  - **`down/down`**: Interface is not operational (e.g., cable issue or misconfiguration).  
  - **`administratively down`**: Interface is manually shut down.  

- **Example**:  
  ```  
  R1# show ip interface brief  
  GigabitEthernet0/0/0   192.168.10.1    YES manual up                    up  
  Serial0/1/1            unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down  
  ```  

**Key Takeaway**: Use `show ip interface brief` to quickly check the operational status of all interfaces.  

---

#### **1.5.3 Verifying IPv6 Link-Local and Multicast Addresses**  
- **IPv6 Addresses**:  
  - **Global Unicast Address**: Manually configured (e.g., `2001:DB8:ACAD:1::1`).  
  - **Link-Local Address**: Automatically assigned (starts with `FE80`).  
  - **Multicast Addresses**: Assigned to interfaces (start with `FF02`).  

- **Example**:  
  ```  
  R1# show ipv6 interface gigabitethernet 0/0/0  
  GigabitEthernet0/0/0 is up, line protocol is up  
    IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is FE80::7279:B3FF:FE92:3130  
    Global unicast address(es):  
      2001:DB8:ACAD:1::1, subnet is 2001:DB8:ACAD:1::/64  
    Joined group address(es):  
      FF02::1  
      FF02::1:FF00:1  
  ```  

**Key Takeaway**: IPv6 interfaces have both link-local and global unicast addresses, and they join multicast groups automatically.  

---

#### **1.5.4 Verifying Interface Configuration**  
- **Command**: `show running-config interface [interface-id]`  
  - Displays the current configuration applied to a specific interface.  
  - Example:  
    ```  
    R1# show running-config interface gigabitethernet 0/0/0  
    interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0  
        description Link to LAN 1  
        ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0  
        ipv6 address 2001:DB8:ACAD:1::1/64  
    ```  

**Key Takeaway**: Use this command to verify the configuration of a specific interface.  

---

#### **1.5.5 Verifying Routes**  
- **IPv4 and IPv6 Routing Tables**:  
  - Directly connected networks are marked with `C` (Connected) or `L` (Local).  
  - Example:  
    ```  
    R1# show ipv6 route  
    C   2001:DB8:ACAD:1::/64 [0/0]  
         via GigabitEthernet0/0/0, directly connected  
    L   2001:DB8:ACAD:1::1/128 [0/0]  
         via GigabitEthernet0/0/0, receive  
    ```  

- **Ping for Connectivity**:  
  - Use `ping` to verify Layer 3 connectivity.  
  - Example:  
    ```  
    R1# ping 2001:DB8:ACAD:1::10  
    Success rate is 100 percent (5/5)  
    ```  

**Key Takeaway**: Use `show ip route` and `show ipv6 route` to verify routing tables, and `ping` to test connectivity.  

---

#### **1.5.6 Filtering Command Output**  
- **Filtering Options**:  
  - **`| include`**: Displays lines that match the filter.  
    ```  
    R1# show ip interface brief | include up  
    ```  
  - **`| exclude`**: Excludes lines that match the filter.  
    ```  
    R1# show ip interface brief | exclude unassigned  
    ```  
  - **`| section`**: Displays entire sections that match the filter.  
    ```  
    R1# show running-config | section line vty  
    ```  
  - **`| begin`**: Displays output starting from the line that matches the filter.  
    ```  
    R1# show ip route | begin Gateway  
    ```  

**Key Takeaway**: Use filtering to refine `show` command output and focus on relevant information.  

---

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Verification Commands**: Use `show ip interface brief`, `show running-config interface`, and `show ip route` to verify configurations.  
- **IPv6 Addresses**: Interfaces have both link-local and global unicast addresses.  
- **Filtering Output**: Use `include`, `exclude`, `section`, and `begin` to refine command output.

### **Title for This Module Section**:  
**"Command History Function and Buffer Management"**

This title covers:  
- **Command History Function**: Recalling previously executed commands.  
- **Buffer Management**: Adjusting the size of the command history buffer.  

You can save this part of the module under this title for easy reference! üìÇüîß

### **Detailed Summary of the Section**  

---

#### **1.5.8 Command History Function**  
The command history function is a useful feature that temporarily stores a list of executed commands for easy recall.  

---

#### **Key Features of Command History**  
1. **Recalling Commands**:  
   - **Previous Commands**: Press `Ctrl+P` or the **Up Arrow** key to recall the most recent commands.  
   - **Next Commands**: Press `Ctrl+N` or the **Down Arrow** key to return to more recent commands.  

2. **Default Behavior**:  
   - The system stores the **last 10 commands** in the history buffer by default.  

3. **Viewing Command History**:  
   - Use the `show history` command to display the contents of the history buffer.  
   - Example:  
     ```  
     R1# show history  
       show ip int brief  
       show interface g0/0/0  
       show ip route  
       show running-config  
       show history  
     ```  

4. **Adjusting History Buffer Size**:  
   - Use the `terminal history size [number]` command to increase or decrease the size of the history buffer for the current session.  
   - Example:  
     ```  
     R1# terminal history size 200  
     ```  
   - **Note**: This change is temporary and applies only to the current session.  

---

#### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Command Recall**: Use `Ctrl+P` (Up Arrow) and `Ctrl+N` (Down Arrow) to navigate through command history.  
- **Buffer Size**: Adjust the history buffer size using `terminal history size [number]`.  
- **View History**: Use `show history` to display the list of recently executed commands.  

---

### **Example Workflow**  
1. **Increase History Buffer Size**:  
   ```  
   R1# terminal history size 200  
   ```  

2. **View Command History**:  
   ```  
   R1# show history  
     show ip int brief  
     show interface g0/0/0  
     show ip route  
     show running-config  
     show history  
     terminal history size 200  
   ```  

3. **Recall Commands**:  
   - Press `Ctrl+P` or the **Up Arrow** to scroll through previous commands.  
   - Press `Ctrl+N` or the **Down Arrow** to return to more recent commands.  

---

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Command History**: A valuable tool for recalling and reusing commands.  
- **Buffer Management**: Adjust the buffer size to suit your needs during a session.  
- **Efficiency**: Use command history to save time and avoid retyping commands.
