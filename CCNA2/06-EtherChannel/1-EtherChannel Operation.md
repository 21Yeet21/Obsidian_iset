### ‚úÖ **6.1.1 Link Aggregation ‚Äì EtherChannel Operation**

#### üîó **What is EtherChannel?**

- **EtherChannel** is a **link aggregation technology** that combines multiple physical Ethernet links into **one logical link**.
    
- It allows **redundant** and **parallel connections** between network devices **without being blocked** by STP.
    

#### üìà **Why Use EtherChannel?**

- Increases **bandwidth** by aggregating multiple interfaces.
    
- Provides **fault-tolerance** and **redundancy**.
    
- Enables **load sharing** across the physical links.
    
- Prevents **STP** from blocking redundant links by treating them as **a single logical interface**.
    

#### üö´ **STP and Redundant Links**

- Normally, STP blocks redundant physical links to prevent loops.
    
- With EtherChannel, STP sees **one logical interface**, so **no physical links are blocked**.

### ‚úÖ **6.1.2 EtherChannel**

#### üí° **Definition and Purpose**

- **EtherChannel** is a **Cisco-developed** method for combining multiple **Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet** ports into one **logical interface**.
    
- This logical interface is called a **Port Channel** or **Channel-group**.
    

#### üß© **How It Works**

- Multiple physical interfaces are **bundled** into a **single virtual port channel interface**.
    
- The switch **treats all links as one**, improving:
    
    - **Bandwidth**
        
    - **Redundancy**
        
    - **Failover**
        
    - **Load balancing**
        
![[Pasted image 20250505204748.png]]


#### üéØ **Key Benefits**

- Prevents **STP** from blocking any links in the group.
    
- Simplifies **network management** (only one logical interface).
    
- Enables **load sharing** across multiple links.
    
    

### üåü **6.1.3 Advantages of EtherChannel**

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Simplified Configuration**

- Configure settings **once on the port channel**, not on each physical interface.
    
- Ensures **consistency** across all bundled links.
    

#### üí∏ **Cost-Effective Bandwidth**

- Uses **existing switch ports** ‚Äî no need to buy **higher-speed links**.
    
- Aggregates **multiple lower-speed links** for greater throughput.
    

#### ‚öñÔ∏è **Load Balancing**

- Spreads traffic across physical links.
    
- Load balancing methods depend on hardware, such as:
    
    - **Source/Destination MAC**
        
    - **Source/Destination IP**
        

#### üîó **Logical Link Aggregation**

- STP views the bundle as **one logical connection**, reducing port blocking.
    
- Only one EtherChannel may be blocked in case of redundancy ‚Äî not individual ports.
    

#### üîÅ **Redundancy Without Topology Change**

- If one link fails, **others stay active** ‚Äî EtherChannel remains up.
    
- No **STP recalculation** is needed, improving **stability and convergence**.
    
    
    
    

### üîß **6.1.4 Implementation Restrictions**

#### ‚ùå **Interface Type Restrictions**

- **Fast Ethernet** and **Gigabit Ethernet** cannot be mixed within a single EtherChannel.
    

#### üöÄ **EtherChannel Port Limitations**

- Each EtherChannel can consist of up to **eight ports**, with bandwidth capabilities of:
    
    - **Fast EtherChannel**: **800 Mbps**.
        
    - **Gigabit EtherChannel**: **8 Gbps**.
        
![[Pasted image 20250505210505.png]]
#### üìà **EtherChannel Limits on Catalyst 2960**

- Supports **up to six EtherChannels**.
    
- Future **IOS versions** and hardware platforms may increase the number of supported EtherChannels and ports per EtherChannel.
    

#### ‚öñÔ∏è **Port Configuration Consistency**

- Configuration must be identical on both devices.
    
    - **Example**: If a port is set to **trunking** on one switch, it must also be trunking on the other side.
        
    - All ports in EtherChannel should be **Layer 2 ports**.
        

#### üîó **Logical Port Channel Interface**

- A **single logical port channel interface** is used for the configuration, affecting all physical interfaces that belong to the EtherChannel.
    

### üîÑ **6.1.5 AutoNegotiation Protocols**

#### üåê **PAgP (Port Aggregation Protocol)**

- A **Cisco proprietary** protocol.
    
- Automatically forms **EtherChannel** between compatible Cisco devices.
    
- Negotiates the inclusion of ports into a single channel based on configuration.
    
- Can operate in two modes:
    
    - **Desirable**: Actively attempts to form a channel.
        
    - **Auto**: Passively waits for the other side to initiate channel formation.
        

#### üîë **LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)**

- An **IEEE standard** protocol (802.3ad).
    
- Supports **interoperability** between devices from different manufacturers.
    
- Allows automatic negotiation of EtherChannel.
    
- Can operate in two modes:
    
    - **Active**: Actively attempts to form an EtherChannel.
        
    - **Passive**: Waits for an active request from the other side to form the channel.
        

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Static EtherChannel**

- A manually configured EtherChannel.
    
- Does **not require negotiation** protocols (PAgP or LACP).
    
- Ports must be explicitly configured to form an EtherChannel without relying on any dynamic protocol.
    

Both **PAgP** and **LACP** are used to create an **EtherChannel** dynamically, ensuring that the configuration is consistent across the links. **Static EtherChannel** is an option when a more controlled setup is needed.

### üîÑ **6.1.6 PAgP Operation**

#### üì° **How PAgP Works**

- **PAgP** (Port Aggregation Protocol) is a Cisco proprietary protocol designed to automate the creation of **EtherChannel** links.
    
- PAgP sends negotiation packets between devices to group **matching Ethernet links** into an EtherChannel, which then functions as a **single port** within the spanning tree.
    
- PAgP ensures configuration consistency across the EtherChannel ports and manages link additions or failures.
    

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **PAgP Modes**

1. **On Mode**
    
    - Forces the interface to form an EtherChannel **without any negotiation**.
        
    - No **PAgP packets** are exchanged in this mode.
        
    - The other side **must also be in On mode** for the EtherChannel to form.
        
2. **PAgP Desirable Mode**
    
    - Places the interface in an **active state** where it **actively sends PAgP packets** to negotiate with the other side.
        
    - The interface will **initiate negotiations** with the other switch to form an EtherChannel.
        
3. **PAgP Auto Mode**
    
    - Places the interface in a **passive state**.
        
    - The interface only **responds to PAgP packets** but **does not initiate negotiation**.
        
    - If the other side is in **Desirable mode**, it will initiate the EtherChannel negotiation.
        

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Considerations**

- **All Ports Must Be Consistent**: When forming an EtherChannel, all ports must have the same **speed, duplex setting**, and **VLAN information**.
    
- **Link Failures**: If any port in the EtherChannel fails, **PAgP ensures the channel remains operational** by managing the link failure and possible reconfiguration.
    

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Example Configuration**

```bash
Switch1(config)# interface range fa0/1 - 2
Switch1(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode desirable

Switch2(config)# interface range fa0/1 - 2
Switch2(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode desirable
```

### üìä **6.1.7 PAgP Mode Settings Example**

In the scenario below, two switches, **S1** and **S2**, are connected via two physical links. The **EtherChannel** can be established based on the **PAgP mode** settings on each side.

#### üåê **EtherChannel Formation Scenarios**

The table below shows how different combinations of **PAgP modes** on **S1** and **S2** impact the establishment of the EtherChannel.

|**S1 Mode**|**S2 Mode**|**Result**|
|---|---|---|
|**On**|**On**|EtherChannel forms, no negotiation (static).|
|**On**|**Desirable**|EtherChannel does **not form** (no negotiation from S1).|
|**On**|**Auto**|EtherChannel does **not form** (no negotiation from S1).|
|**Desirable**|**On**|EtherChannel does **not form** (no negotiation from S2).|
|**Desirable**|**Desirable**|EtherChannel **forms** (both initiate negotiation).|
|**Desirable**|**Auto**|EtherChannel **forms** (S1 initiates, S2 responds).|
|**Auto**|**On**|EtherChannel does **not form** (no negotiation from S1).|
|**Auto**|**Desirable**|EtherChannel **forms** (S2 initiates, S1 responds).|
|**Auto**|**Auto**|EtherChannel does **not form** (both sides passive).|

#### üö¶ **Key Points:**

- **On Mode**: Forces the interface into an EtherChannel without negotiation. The other side must also be in **On** mode for the EtherChannel to form.
    
- **Desirable Mode**: Actively initiates negotiations for an EtherChannel.
    
- **Auto Mode**: Passively waits for the other side to initiate negotiations. If both sides are set to **Auto**, no EtherChannel will form because there is no initiation.




### ‚öôÔ∏è **6.1.8 LACP Operation**

LACP (**Link Aggregation Control Protocol**) is an **IEEE standard (802.3ad)** that allows multiple physical ports to be bundled together into a single logical channel. LACP provides automatic link bundling through negotiation, much like **PAgP**, but it is an **open standard**, which allows it to work in **multivendor environments**. It is supported on Cisco devices as well as many other vendors.

#### üîë **Key Features of LACP:**

- **Standard Protocol**: LACP is part of the **IEEE 802.3ad** specification, now defined in the **IEEE 802.1AX** standard.
    
- **Automatic Bundling**: LACP automatically groups compatible physical ports into a single EtherChannel.
    
- **Multivendor Compatibility**: Unlike PAgP, LACP is an open standard that can be used in multivendor environments, making it more versatile.
    

#### üí° **LACP Mode Options:**

- **On**: This mode forces the interface into an EtherChannel without any dynamic negotiation using LACP. It works only if the other side is also in **On** mode. If the other side is using **LACP active** or **LACP passive**, no EtherChannel will form.
    
- **LACP Active**: In this mode, the port actively initiates negotiations by sending LACP packets to the other side to establish an EtherChannel. This is equivalent to the **PAgP Desirable** mode.
    
- **LACP Passive**: In this mode, the port listens for LACP packets and responds to them, but does not initiate the negotiation process. It‚Äôs equivalent to the **PAgP Auto** mode.
    

#### üîÑ **LACP and Failover:**

- LACP supports up to **eight active links** in an EtherChannel, as well as **eight standby links**. A standby link will automatically be activated if any active link fails, providing **redundancy** and **load balancing**.
    

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**

- LACP and PAgP are not compatible with each other. You cannot use both protocols on the same EtherChannel. Only one protocol should be used for negotiation between two switches.
    

#### üìå **Comparison of LACP and PAgP:**

- **LACP** is an IEEE standard and works in multivendor environments, while **PAgP** is Cisco proprietary and works only with Cisco devices.
    
- Both protocols use similar modes for negotiating EtherChannel links but are used in different scenarios depending on the network's requirements and equipment compatibility.
    





### üîÑ **6.1.9 LACP Mode Settings Example**

When configuring **LACP** on two switches, whether an **EtherChannel** is established depends on the **mode settings** on both sides of the channel. Here's a table that illustrates how the different LACP mode combinations between Switch 1 (S1) and Switch 2 (S2) determine if the EtherChannel is formed.

---

|**S1 Mode**|**S2 Mode**|**EtherChannel Formation**|
|---|---|---|
|**LACP Active**|**LACP Active**|EtherChannel **forms**. Both sides actively negotiate to establish the EtherChannel.|
|**LACP Active**|**LACP Passive**|EtherChannel **forms**. S1 initiates negotiation; S2 responds.|
|**LACP Passive**|**LACP Active**|EtherChannel **forms**. S2 initiates negotiation; S1 responds.|
|**LACP Passive**|**LACP Passive**|**No EtherChannel**. Both sides are waiting for each other to initiate the negotiation.|
|**LACP Active**|**On**|**No EtherChannel**. The "On" mode doesn't use LACP negotiation, so no channel forms.|
|**On**|**LACP Active**|**No EtherChannel**. The "On" mode doesn't use LACP negotiation, so no channel forms.|
|**On**|**On**|EtherChannel **forms** without negotiation. Both sides are forced into the channel unconditionally.|

---

### üìå **Explanation of the Combinations**:

- **LACP Active & LACP Active**: Both switches actively try to form an EtherChannel, leading to successful negotiation and channel creation.
    
- **LACP Active & LACP Passive**: One switch actively initiates the negotiation, while the other listens and responds, successfully forming the EtherChannel.
    
- **LACP Passive & LACP Passive**: Neither switch initiates the negotiation, so no EtherChannel forms.
    
- **LACP Active & On**: The "On" mode doesn‚Äôt use LACP for negotiation, meaning no EtherChannel is formed.
    
- **On & On**: This forces the interface to channel without negotiation. Both sides must manually configure the EtherChannel, bypassing LACP negotiation.
