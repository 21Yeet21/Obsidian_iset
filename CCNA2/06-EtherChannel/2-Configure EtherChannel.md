### üåê **6.2 Configure EtherChannel**

#### üìù **6.2.1 Configuration Guidelines**

When configuring **EtherChannel**, it is essential to follow certain **guidelines** to ensure proper functioning. Here are the important configuration points:

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **EtherChannel Support**

- **All Ethernet interfaces** must support EtherChannel.
    
- **Interfaces do not need to be contiguous** (they can be on different parts of the switch).
    

#### üîÑ **Speed and Duplex**

- All interfaces in an **EtherChannel must have the same speed** and **duplex settings**.
    
- Mismatched settings will prevent the formation of the EtherChannel.

#### üì° **VLAN Match**

- All interfaces within the **EtherChannel bundle** must either be:
    
    - Assigned to the **same VLAN**, or
        
    - Configured as a **trunk** (for multiple VLANs).
        

#### üî¢ **Range of VLANs**

- For **trunking EtherChannels**, all interfaces must have the **same allowed VLAN range**.
    
- If VLAN ranges do not match, the EtherChannel **will not form**.
    



---

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Configuration Changes**

- Changes in port channel settings should be done in the **port channel interface configuration mode**.
    
- Applying configurations to the port channel interface automatically affects the member interfaces.
    
- However, changes applied directly to member interfaces do **not** propagate to the port channel interface, potentially causing compatibility issues.
    

---

#### üöÄ **Port Channel Modes**

The **port channel** can be configured in the following modes:

- **Access Mode**
    
- **Trunk Mode** (most common)
    
- **Routed Mode** (less common)
    

### üåê **6.2.2 LACP Configuration Example**

To configure an **EtherChannel** using **LACP** (Link Aggregation Control Protocol), follow the steps outlined below. This example demonstrates how to set up EtherChannel between two switches, **S1** and **S2**, using **LACP**.

---

#### **Topology**

- **Switch S1** is connected to **Switch S2** via **two physical network connections**:
    
    - **Fa0/1 on S1** ‚Üî **Fa0/1 on S2**
        
    - **Fa0/2 on S1** ‚Üî **Fa0/2 on S2**

### **Steps to Configure EtherChannel with LACP**

#### **Step 1: Select Interfaces for EtherChannel**

- In **global configuration mode**, select the interfaces that will be part of the **EtherChannel group**. This is done using the **interface range** command, which allows multiple interfaces to be configured at the same time.
    

```bash
S1(config)# interface range FastEthernet 0/1 - 2
```

#### **Step 2: Assign the Channel Group with LACP Mode**

- Use the **channel-group** command to assign the selected interfaces to the EtherChannel group. The **mode active** command sets the EtherChannel to use **LACP** in **active mode** (initiating negotiations with the other side).
    

```bash
S1(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode active
```

- This creates the port-channel interface automatically (in this example, **Port-channel 1**).
    

#### **Step 3: Configure the Port-Channel Interface**

- After creating the port channel, configure **Layer 2 settings** (such as trunking) by entering **port-channel interface configuration mode**.
    

```bash
S1(config-if-range)# exit
S1(config)# interface port-channel 1
S1(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
S1(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,2,20
```

- This configures **Port-channel 1** as a **trunk port** with the allowed VLANs set to **1, 2, and 20**.
    


---

### **Important Notes:**

- **LACP Active Mode**: In this mode, the switch actively negotiates with the other side of the link to form an EtherChannel.
    
- **Port-Channel Interface**: Once the EtherChannel is created, you can configure additional settings, such as VLANs or trunking mode, on the **Port-channel interface**.
